Gcovr provides a utility for managing the use of the GNU gcov utility and
generating summarized code coverage results. This command is inspired by the
Python coverage.py package, which provides a similar utility in Python. The
gcovr command produces either compact human-readable summary reports, machine
readable XML reports (in Cobertura format) or simple HTML reports. Thus, gcovr
can be viewed as a command-line alternative to the lcov utility, which runs gcov
and generates an HTML-formatted report.
