Stress test is to reveal programming errors in the kernel, 
that could lead to downtime.
Testing is divided into two different tactics: general stress test 
programs and regression test scenarios.
The general test programs are a collection of small test programs, 
that primarily stress test the VFS subsystem. One other test program 
generates VM pressure, thus causing swapping. These are the primary 
ingredients for discovering locking errors on a SMP system.
The regression test scenarios are a collection of shell scripts 
that cover a much wider area of the kernel.
